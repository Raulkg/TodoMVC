## About the application - Todo's

Below is a simple ToDo application that we would like to you build, Following are the [user stories]

1. As a user, I should be able to view a page with a task list on it.
2. As a user, I should be able to add a new task to the task list.
3. As a user, I should be able to mark a task in the list as completed.

This is single user application and do not worry about cross-user scenarios or security in that respect.

A task is simply defined as a small piece of work with a description and can exist in one of two simple states: completed or not completed. As for the list, consider it empty any time someone first visits your index page; you don't have to worry about saving the state of your application between uses.
