## About the application - Todo's

Below is a simple ToDo application that we would like to you build, Following are the [user stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories):

1. As a user, I should be able to view a page with a task list on it.
2. As a user, I should be able to add a new task to the task list.
3. As a user, I should be able to remove a task from the task list.
4. As a user, I should be able to reorder a task in the task list.
5. As a user, I should be able to edit the name of a task in the task list.
6. As a user, I should be able to mark a task in the list as completed.

This is single user application and do not worry about cross-user scenarios or security in that respect.

A task is simply defined as a small piece of work with a description and can exist in one of two simple states: completed or not completed. As for the list, consider it empty any time someone first visits your index page; you don't have to worry about saving the state of your application between uses.

### How to start

1. Fork this repository into your own Bitbucket branch.
2. Solve the problem below, checking in to your branch as you go as if this were a real project you're working on. Note that we're also testing your familiarity with Bitbucket/Git. We will look at your commit history closely.
3. Submit a pull request back to this repository with your solution when finished.

### Architecture

1. Implement the project with ASP.NET MVC. Please use JavaScript/Jquery if required on the front end. 
2. Implement back end with ASP.NET Web API which would be the Service layer and data access with SQL Express.
3. Make sure you write unit tests for the code using MOQ for .NET.
